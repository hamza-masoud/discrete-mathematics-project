incrypt and decrypt work uing a number and you first time should enter the secet number (and this is the key, you can generate one or add it manully)
don't forigt to save the key because you need it to decrypt the file after encrypt it
### step two

enter the file you want to encrypt or decrypt the file
when I use the key here

and here

this is read the caharacter and change it to byptes and integer so anyone read it will not be able to get a real text
#### here an example to use the project 
1. download the app in your PC and you frind PC
2. generate a key and share it only with your frind
3. create a file with text or any file can encrypted (I didn't test it on images or any other type of files)
4. encrypt the file with the key that you share it with him
5. send the file to your frind (any one will access the file will not be able to read it)
6. decrypt with the same key
7. know you have the same message and no one can read it :)


## compress and decompress

first choose the file you want ti compress or decompress
then get save the file after get it

#### problem
there is an problem with the compress and decompress and it the size actually the file will be biger twise because the in saveing the integer 
the integer should stored as it (4 bypte) and it the problem every integer stored to more than 4 byptes 
also the sapce take one bypte and also a problem 
to fix it we should change the sore method and it's not our main aim in this case 


### thank you for every thing this is th project
you can add issue if there is
